# Medical Masks Detection and Classification

## 1. Purpose
This repository is for research purposes. My research is about classification and detection of medical masks. System will open the door for medical mask wearer.

## 2. Method
This system use CNN for classification and detection. There are 4 Main Programs. 
1. prep.py --> Image preprocessing using YCbCr
2. train.py --> Training model with CNN
3. testing.py --> Test model with limited number of images
4. aktuator.py --> To be implemented in minimum system (raspberry pi)
